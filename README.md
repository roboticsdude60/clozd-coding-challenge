# Getting Started

## Installing Dependencies

Make sure that npm and yarn are both installed.

Install Server Dependencies

```
npm install
```

Install Client Dependencies

```
cd client/
npm install
```

## Start Development Server

To start the server, run the following:

```
npm run dev
```

# Database

## Technologies

- SQLite
  > The SQLite database is stored in a file locally.

## Seeding Database

The repository comes with the database pre-seeded. If you need to reset the database to its original state, run the following:

```
npm run seed
```

## Running SQL Queries on the Database

This repository uses the `sqlite3` npm package. In `/db`, we already connect to the database file for you. Simply import `/db/index.js` to the file in which you need it and start running queries.

For more information on how to use `sqlite3`, [read the docs here.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)

## Changing the Database Structure

If needed for your coding challenge, you may change the structure of the database. One way you could accomplish this is by:

1. Deleting the file `/db/test.db`
2. Changing the migration file (`/db/migrate.js`)
3. Running `npm run migrate`
4. If necessary, change the seed file (`/db/seed.js`) and run `npm run seed`

# Server

## Technologies

- Node
- Express
- sqlite3

## Server Requests

The client is built using Create React App. The command listed above for starting the development server is enough to start the express server and Create React App.

To make server requests, simply make the request with a relative path. The requests should already be proxied from the client server port (3000) to the express server port (5000).

example:

```
// relative route
await fetch('/my/route/here');

/* AVOID DOING THIS */
// absolute route
await fetch('localhost:5000/my/route/here');
```

# Client

## Technologies

- React
- React Router
